# Files for GitHub Upload

The following files need to be uploaded to your GitHub repository for Glitch hosting support:

## Glitch Files Directory

Create a directory called `glitch-files` with these files:

1. `server.js` - The main signaling server for Glitch
2. `package.json` - Dependencies for the Glitch server
3. `glitch.json` - Glitch configuration
4. `README.md` - Instructions for Glitch users
5. `setup.js` - Helper script to set up the Glitch project

## Documentation 

1. `GLITCH-SETUP.md` - Detailed instructions for setting up a Glitch server
2. `GITHUB-FILES.md` - This file, listing required files

## Updated Application Files

1. Update `public/renderer.js` to include the Glitch server URL in the `SIGNALING_SERVERS` array

## File Structure

Your repository should have this structure for Glitch support:

```
bizxm/
├── public/
│   ├── renderer.js  (updated with Glitch URL)
│   └── ... (other public files)
├── src/
│   └── ... (source files)
├── glitch-files/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── glitch.json
│   ├── README.md
│   └── setup.js
├── GLITCH-SETUP.md
├── GITHUB-FILES.md
└── ... (other project files)
```

## Instructions for Users

When users clone your repository, they'll need to:

1. Follow the instructions in `GLITCH-SETUP.md` to set up their Glitch server
2. Update the URL in their local copy of `renderer.js`
3. Build the application for their platform

## Important Notes

- The `glitch-files` directory is specifically for Glitch hosting and doesn't affect the main application
- Users should update `public/renderer.js` with their own Glitch URL before building
- All required Glitch files are in the `glitch-files` directory for easy organization
